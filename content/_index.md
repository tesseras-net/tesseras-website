Tesseras is a peer-to-peer network for preserving human memories across
millennia.

## Why Tesseras Exists

Every year, platforms shut down, companies fail, and file formats become
unreadable. Personal photos vanish when a cloud service closes. Home videos rot
on obsolete media. Letters are lost in abandoned email accounts. Our memories
deserve better than depending on any single company, format, or infrastructure.

## How It Works

Each person creates a **tessera** — a self-contained time capsule of memories
(photos, audio, video, text) that survives independently.

- **Peer-to-peer** — your tessera is replicated across a network of volunteers,
  not stored on corporate servers
- **Erasure coding** — your data is split into redundant fragments so it
  survives individual node failures
- **No company dependency** — the network runs on open protocols, open source
  software, and mutual aid
- **Self-describing format** — each tessera contains everything needed to decode
  itself, even centuries from now
- **Open source** — ISC license, built in Rust

## Current Status

Tesseras is in Phase 4 — Resilience and Scale. The core format, cryptographic
foundations, peer-to-peer network, replication, GraphQL API, and Flutter app are
built. We are now working on Shamir's Secret Sharing for heir key recovery,
advanced NAT traversal, and performance tuning.
