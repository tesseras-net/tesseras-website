date = 2026-02-15
description = "Tesseras now lets you split your cryptographic identity into shares distributed to trusted heirs — any threshold of them can reconstruct your keys, but fewer reveal nothing."
+++

What happens to your memories when you die? Until now, Tesseras could preserve
content across millennia — but the private and sealed keys died with their
owner. Phase 4 continues with a solution: Shamir's Secret Sharing, a
cryptographic scheme that lets you split your identity into shares and
distribute them to the people you trust most.

The math is elegant: you choose a threshold T and a total N. Any T shares
reconstruct the full secret; T-1 shares reveal absolutely nothing. This is not
"almost nothing" — it is information-theoretically secure. An attacker with one
fewer share than the threshold has exactly zero bits of information about the
secret, no matter how much computing power they have.

## What was built

**GF(256) finite field arithmetic** (`tesseras-crypto/src/shamir/gf256.rs`) —
Shamir's Secret Sharing requires arithmetic in a finite field. We implement
GF(256) using the same irreducible polynomial as AES (x^8 + x^4 + x^3 + x + 1),
with compile-time lookup tables for logarithm and exponentiation. All operations
are constant-time via table lookups — no branches on secret data. The module
includes Horner's method for polynomial evaluation and Lagrange interpolation at
x=0 for secret recovery. 233 lines, exhaustively tested: all 256 elements for
identity/inverse properties, commutativity, and associativity.

**ShamirSplitter** (`tesseras-crypto/src/shamir/mod.rs`) — The core
split/reconstruct API. `split()` takes a secret byte slice, a configuration
(threshold T, total N), and the owner's Ed25519 public key. For each byte of the
secret, it constructs a random polynomial of degree T-1 over GF(256) with the
secret byte as the constant term, then evaluates it at N distinct points.
`reconstruct()` takes T or more shares and recovers the secret via Lagrange
interpolation. Both operations include extensive validation: threshold bounds,
session consistency, owner fingerprint matching, and BLAKE3 checksum
verification.

**HeirShare format** — Each share is a self-contained, serializable artifact
with:

- Format version (v1) for forward compatibility
- Share index (1..N) and threshold/total metadata
- Session ID (random 8 bytes) — prevents mixing shares from different split
  sessions
- Owner fingerprint (first 8 bytes of BLAKE3 hash of the Ed25519 public key)
- Share data (the Shamir y-values, same length as the secret)
- BLAKE3 checksum over all preceding fields

Shares are serialized in two formats: **MessagePack** (compact binary, for
programmatic use) and **base64 text** (human-readable, for printing and physical
storage). The text format includes a header with metadata and delimiters:

```
--- TESSERAS HEIR SHARE ---
Format: v1
Owner: a1b2c3d4e5f6a7b8 (fingerprint)
Share: 1 of 3 (threshold: 2)
Session: 9f8e7d6c5b4a3210
Created: 2026-02-15

<base64-encoded MessagePack data>
--- END HEIR SHARE ---
```

This format is designed to be printed on paper, stored in a safe deposit box, or
engraved on metal. The header is informational — only the base64 payload is
parsed during reconstruction.

**CLI integration** (`tesseras-cli/src/commands/heir.rs`) — Three new
subcommands:

- `tes heir create` — splits your Ed25519 identity into heir shares. Prompts for
  confirmation (your full identity is at stake), generates both `.bin` and
  `.txt` files for each share, and writes `heir_meta.json` to your identity
  directory.
- `tes heir reconstruct` — loads share files (auto-detects binary vs text
  format), validates consistency, reconstructs the secret, derives the Ed25519
  keypair, and optionally installs it to `~/.tesseras/identity/` (with automatic
  backup of the existing identity).
- `tes heir info` — displays share metadata and verifies the checksum without
  exposing any secret material.

**Secret blob format** — Identity keys are serialized into a versioned blob
before splitting: a version byte (0x01), a flags byte (0x00 for Ed25519-only),
followed by the 32-byte Ed25519 secret key. This leaves room for future
expansion when X25519 and ML-KEM-768 private keys are integrated into the heir
share system.

**Testing** — 20 unit tests for ShamirSplitter (roundtrip, all share
combinations, insufficient shares, wrong owner, wrong session, threshold-1
boundary, large secrets up to ML-KEM-768 key size). 7 unit tests for GF(256)
arithmetic (exhaustive field properties). 3 property-based tests with proptest
(arbitrary secrets up to 5000 bytes, arbitrary T-of-N configurations,
information-theoretic security verification). Serialization roundtrip tests for
both MessagePack and base64 text formats. 2 integration tests covering the
complete heir lifecycle: generate identity, split into shares, serialize,
deserialize, reconstruct, verify keypair, and sign/verify with reconstructed
keys.

## Architecture decisions

- **GF(256) over GF(prime)**: we use GF(256) rather than a prime field because
  it maps naturally to bytes — each element is a single byte, each share is the
  same length as the secret. No big-integer arithmetic, no modular reduction, no
  padding. This is the same approach used by most real-world Shamir
  implementations including SSSS and Hashicorp Vault.
- **Compile-time lookup tables**: the LOG and EXP tables for GF(256) are
  computed at compile time using `const fn`. This means zero runtime
  initialization cost and constant-time operations via table lookups rather than
  loops.
- **Session ID prevents cross-session mixing**: each call to `split()` generates
  a fresh random session ID. If an heir accidentally uses shares from two
  different split sessions (e.g., before and after a key rotation),
  reconstruction fails cleanly with a validation error rather than producing
  garbage output.
- **BLAKE3 checksums detect corruption**: each share includes a BLAKE3 checksum
  over its contents. This catches bit rot, transmission errors, and accidental
  truncation before any reconstruction attempt. A share printed on paper and
  scanned back via OCR will fail the checksum if a single character is wrong.
- **Owner fingerprint for identification**: shares include the first 8 bytes of
  BLAKE3(Ed25519 public key) as a fingerprint. This lets heirs verify which
  identity a share belongs to without revealing the full public key. During
  reconstruction, the fingerprint is cross-checked against the recovered key.
- **Dual format for resilience**: both binary (MessagePack) and text (base64)
  formats are generated because physical media has different failure modes than
  digital storage. A USB drive might fail; paper survives. A QR code might be
  unreadable; base64 text can be manually typed.
- **Blob versioning**: the secret is wrapped in a versioned blob (version +
  flags + key material) so future versions can include additional keys (X25519,
  ML-KEM-768) without breaking backward compatibility with existing shares.

## What comes next

- **Phase 4 continued: Resilience and Scale** — advanced NAT traversal
  (STUN/TURN), performance tuning (connection pooling, fragment caching, SQLite
  WAL), security audits, institutional node onboarding, OS packaging
- **Phase 5: Exploration and Culture** — public tessera browser by
  era/location/theme/language, institutional curation, genealogy integration,
  physical media export (M-DISC, microfilm, acid-free paper with QR)

With Shamir's Secret Sharing, Tesseras closes the last critical gap in long-term
preservation. Your memories survive infrastructure failures through erasure
coding. Your privacy survives quantum computers through hybrid encryption. And
now, your identity survives you — passed on to the people you chose, requiring
their cooperation to unlock what you left behind.
