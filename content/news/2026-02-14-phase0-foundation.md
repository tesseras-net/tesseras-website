description = "The foundation crates for Tesseras are now in place — core domain types, cryptographic primitives, SQLite storage, and a working CLI."
+++

The first milestone of the Tesseras project is complete. Phase 0 establishes the
foundation that every future component will build on: domain types,
cryptography, storage, and a usable command-line interface.

## What was built

**tesseras-core** — The domain layer defines the tessera format: `ContentHash`
(BLAKE3, 32 bytes), `NodeId` (Kademlia, 20 bytes), memory types (Moment,
Reflection, Daily, Relation, Object), visibility modes (Private, Circle, Public,
PublicAfterDeath, Sealed), and a plain-text manifest format that can be parsed
by any programming language for the next thousand years. The application service
layer (`TesseraService`) handles create, verify, export, and list operations
through port traits, following hexagonal architecture.

**tesseras-crypto** — Ed25519 key generation, signing, and verification. A
dual-signature framework (Ed25519 + ML-DSA placeholder) ready for post-quantum
migration. BLAKE3 content hashing. Reed-Solomon erasure coding behind a feature
flag for future replication.

**tesseras-storage** — SQLite index via rusqlite with plain-SQL migrations.
Filesystem blob store with content-addressable layout
(`blobs/<tessera_hash>/<memory_hash>/<filename>`). Identity key persistence on
disk.

**tesseras-cli** — A working `tesseras` binary with five commands:

- `init` — generates Ed25519 identity, creates SQLite database
- `create <dir>` — scans a directory for media files, creates a signed tessera
- `verify <hash>` — checks signature and file integrity
- `export <hash> <dest>` — writes a self-contained tessera directory
- `list` — shows a table of stored tesseras

**Testing** — 67+ tests across the workspace: unit tests in every module,
property-based tests (proptest) for hex roundtrips and manifest serialization,
integration tests covering the full create-verify-export cycle including
tampered file and invalid signature detection. Zero clippy warnings.

## Architecture decisions

- **Hexagonal architecture**: crypto operations are injected via trait objects
  (`Box<dyn Hasher>`, `Box<dyn ManifestSigner>`, `Box<dyn ManifestVerifier>`),
  keeping the core crate free of concrete crypto dependencies.
- **Feature flags**: the `service` feature on tesseras-core gates the async
  application layer. The `classical` and `erasure` features on tesseras-crypto
  control which algorithms are compiled in.
- **Plain-text manifest**: parseable without any binary format library, with
  explicit `blake3:` hash prefixes and human-readable layout.

## What comes next

Phase 0 is the local-only foundation. The road ahead:

- **Phase 1: Networking** — QUIC transport (quinn), Kademlia DHT for peer
  discovery, NAT traversal
- **Phase 2: Replication** — Reed-Solomon erasure coding over the network,
  repair loops, bilateral reciprocity (no blockchain, no tokens)
- **Phase 3: Clients** — Flutter mobile/desktop app via flutter_rust_bridge,
  GraphQL API, WASM browser node
- **Phase 4: Hardening** — ML-DSA post-quantum signatures, packaging for
  Alpine/Arch/Debian/FreeBSD/OpenBSD, CI on SourceHut

The tessera format is stable. Everything built from here connects to and extends
what exists today.
