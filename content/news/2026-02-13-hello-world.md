+++

Today we're announcing the Tesseras project: a peer-to-peer network for
preserving human memories across millennia.

Tesseras is built on a simple idea — your photos, recordings, and writings
deserve to outlast any company, platform, or file format. Each person creates a
tessera, a self-contained time capsule that the network keeps alive through
mutual aid and redundancy.

The project is in its earliest stage. We're building the foundation: tools to
create, verify, and export tesseras offline. The network layer, replication, and
apps will follow.

If this mission resonates with you, [join the mailing list](/subscriptions/) or
